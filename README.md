# This is a pub/sub architecture guided project
## the project itself implements a strategy cli game made of clients(subscribers/players) and server(publisher/game master) 
### some of the queues need to be added manually in rabbitmq

The starting code used in project was from Boot.dev's [Learn Pub/Sub](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-pub-sub-rabbitmq-golang) course.
